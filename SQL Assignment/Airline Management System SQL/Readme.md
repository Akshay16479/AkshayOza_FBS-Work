✈️ Airline Management System | SQL & Database Design Project

Designed and implemented a relational database–driven Airline Management System using MySQL, focusing on efficient data organization, integrity, and real-world airline operations.

Key Highlights:

Created a normalized database schema to manage core airline entities such as Passengers, Flights, Aircraft, Bookings, Crew, Fares, and Itineraries.

Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and DEFAULT constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

Established relationships between tables to accurately represent real-world airline workflows like flight bookings, passenger itineraries, crew assignments, and fare management.

Modeled Flight–Crew Assignment (FCA) to handle crew scheduling and duty tracking.

Designed booking and fare structures to support reservation status, payment tracking, seat class, and pricing.

Technologies Used:

MySQL

SQL (DDL, Constraints, Relationships)

Database Normalization

Learning Outcomes:

Strong understanding of relational database design

Hands-on experience with entity relationships and constraints

Improved skills in data modeling for real-time systems

This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable and structured databases suitable for real-world applications like airline reservation and management systems.
